# AI-in-Banqi
Research on implementing an AI in Banqi using Alpha-Beta pruning. Since this chess game has a lot more outcome than regular chess game, it's impossible to just get the Alpha-Beta pruning working without any pre-computation to reduce the possible moves. This project includes coding a Unity game and use probability calculation for the AI algorithm, the calculation will find out which moves are more favourable than others to reduce the size of the search tree.

Result:
The probability calculation did largely reduce the branching factor, however it still has room for improving the AI "thinking" speed and strength.
